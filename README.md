[Jest-cucumber](https://github.com/bencompton/jest-cucumber)
Plugin allows you to generate unit tests in Gherkin format, is an innovative way to approach unit tests. The technique is typically used for end-to-end testing, but by implementing it in unit tests, developers can get a more structured approach to their tests, which can speed up overall software development. Another benefit of using Gherkin for unit testing is that it can help ensure that all necessary test cases are included in tests. This is because a natural language, as opposed to a programming language, encourages a declarative writing style that helps make sure that all relevant details are included in each test case. This can save time when a programmer is trying to track down why a particular test failed. Overall, using the Gherkin unit test generation plugin is an innovative way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of unit tests.
